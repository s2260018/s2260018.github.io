- Session 1 [2024-04-23 Tue]:
  - Planning;
  - Improve TRA;
  - Improve proposal;
  - Begin constructing first version of setup;
- Session 2 [2024-04-24 Wed]:
  - Construct first version of setup;
  - Test first version of setup;
  - Make necessary modifications to setup;
  - Measure background noise;
  - Modify setup if background noise is too high;
- Session 3 [2024-04-26 Fri]:
  - If setup is working:
    - measure background noise;
    - measure $G(f)$;
  - Else: improve setup;
  - If time permits, measure some resistances;
- Session 4 [2024-04-30 Tue]:
  - Measure resistances;
  - Analyse some data;
  - Intervision (45 min.);
  - Process feedback (15 min.);
- Session 5 [2024-05-01 Wed]:
  - If previous data indicates the setup is not working correctly, improve setup.
  - Measure all available resistors;
  - Analyse the data for all resistors;
- Session 6 [2024-05-03 Fri]:
  - Modify setup to allow changing temperature;
  - Measure some resistors for different temperatures;
  - Analyse the data, and determine if small temperature changes are sufficient;
  - If needed, modify setup to allow more extreme temperature differences;
  - Measure resistors for a range of temperatures;
- Session 7 [2024-05-07 Tue]:
  - Analyse temperature data, and if needed take more data;
- Session 8 [2024-05-08 Wed]:
