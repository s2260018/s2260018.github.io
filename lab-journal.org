* Session 1
Session 1, 23rd of April 2024
- Preparatory files:
  - [[file:proposal/proposal.pdf][Proposal]]
  - [[file:proposal/tra.pdf][Task Risk Analysis]]
  - [[file:planning/planning.org][Planning]]
- Based on received feedback, the task risk analysis and the proposal were amended.
- Some time was spent on planning the coming sessions.
- Building the setup:
  - The following parts have been ordered:
    - 9 Volt battery;
    - Integrated Systems LSK189-TO-92-3L-BK JFETs (10 pc.);
    - Linear Technology LT1023CN8PBF Op Amps (2 pc.);
    - Resistors: 390 Ω, 39 kΩ, 10 MΩ, 100 of each;
    - Capacitors: 150 pF (50 pc.);
  - Two 1 μF capacitors (cylindrical, black Jackcon), a 100 nF (very small, light blue, marked "104k") and a 1.5 nF capacitor (flat, orange, marked "152") have been taken from the capacitor box;
    - A slightly darker blue one was between the 100 nF capacitors, the barely legible marking "104k" confirms the light blue one is correct.
  - Two 1 kΩ resistors were taken from the resistor box.
  - A Rigol DS1052E is taken and will be used both to measure the output and as a ground.
  - Part of the setup is constructed on the breadboard, to be continued tomorrow.
- End of session. Plan for tomorrow:
  - finish constructing the setup;
  - measure output with input shorted and with resistor;
  - analyse the output to determine whether the system work correctly and if so, is sufficiently good.
* Session 2
Session 2, 24th of april 2024
- The rest of the circuit is constructed on the breadboard.
  The ground is connected to the ground of the oscilloscope.
  The output is connected to the oscilloscope input and the ground.
  An image of the setup is shown in Figure [[fig:s2-breadboard]]

  #+NAME: fig:s2-breadboard
  #+CAPTION: A photograph of the breadboard with the setup, represented by Figure 1 in the [[file:proposal/proposal.pdf][proposal]].  The jumper cables in the top left and bottom left respectively connect to the positive and negative pole of the battery.  The cable on the bottom right connects to the oscilloscope ground.  The red cable on the right connects to the oscilloscope input.  The dark grey diagonal cable on the left shorts the input to the ground, and can be replaced with the resistor under test.

- Some measurements of the system were taken with the input shorted, like in Figure [[fig:s2-breadboard]], to measure the noise of the amplifier (and the surroundings).  There a substantial (~8 V) DC voltage present, which hinders measurements.  The oscilloscope can not measure finer than 500 mV per division before the DC offset becomes too great.  Some measurements were recorded at 500 mV/div and 1 ms, 1 μs and 50 ms, using =single_device.py=, and saved on disk with timestamp and resolution in the filename.

- A solution to the DC problem was helpfully provided by the TAs: the channel on the oscilloscope was changed to AC coupling, as it was in DC coupling before.  The signal can now be measured at much greater voltage resolution.  The filenames of the previous data were updated to reflect that they were measured in DC mode.

- Some measurements were taken with the input shorted, in AC coupling mode.  Initially, a ~50 Hz signal dominated the output (Figure [[fig:ac-interference-short]]), presumed to be AC power grid interference, based on its frequency.
  After disconnecting and reconnecting the input short, this behaviour ceased (Figure [[fig:no-ac-interference]]).
  The behaviour resumed when keeping the input disconnected (Figure [[fig:ac-interference-void]]).
  This suggests it was a connection issue.
 
  #+NAME: fig:ac-interference-short
  #+CAPTION: $V(t)$ measured with the input shorted, with resolution 10 mV / div., 5 ms / div.  The frequence of the large oscillations is approximately 50 Hz, suggestion it is interference from the AC power grid.

  #+NAME: fig:no-ac-interference
  #+CAPTION: $V(t)$ measured with the input shorted, with resolution 10 mV / div., 5 ms / div.  The 50 Hz oscillations are gone, and remained gone with subsequent measurements.  $V_{\mathrm{RMS}} ≈ 2.3\text{ mV}$.

  #+NAME: fig:ac-interference-void
  #+CAPTION:  $V(t)$ measured with the input disconnected, with resolution 10 mV / div., 5 ms / div.  The oscillations are again approximately 50 Hz, like Figure [[fig:ac-interference-short]].  This persists with subsequente measurements.

- End of session.  Plan for next session:

  - Take some more shorted measurements for background noise determination;

  - Measure some resistors;

  - Modify the setup by using two 9 V batteries, to power the op amps with +9 V and -9 V instead of +9 V and 0 V.
* Session 3
Session 3, 26th of april 2024
- The setup is connected and the signal is visually checked on the oscilloscope to check if everything is still connected properly.  Everything looks the same as last time.
- Some more data with the input shorted was recorded, with 10 ms / div. and 500 μs / div.
- Four measurements with 10 ms / div. and four with 500 μs / div. give respectively $V_{RMS} \approx 1.29\ \pm\ 0.07\ \text{mV}$ and $V_{RMS} \approx 1.52\ \pm\ 0.12\ \text{mV}$.  The error is the standard deviation.
- Several different resistors I have on hand are put under test, and several oscilloscope traces will be recorded for each, with the smallest voltage per division allowed without frequent clipping, and with both 10 ms and 500 us time settings.
  - 390 \Omega :: 5 mV / div. can be used without clipping most of the time.
    Ten measurements have been taken with each setting.
  - 39 k\Omega :: The same settings and procedures are used.
    As a preliminary judgement, the noise looks no different than with 390 \Omega.
  - 10 M\Omega :: The signal seems slightly noisier, judging by the $V_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ readout, but the AC interference is now visible again (Figure [[fig:ac-interference-10M]]), though to a lesser degree than with the input disconnected.
- The calculated $V_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ are recorded in table [[tab:s3-resistor-noise]].

#+NAME: fig:ac-interference-10M
#+CAPTION: $V(t)$ measured with a 10 MΩ resistor connected.  Like with the input disconnected, AC interference is visibly present.  The signal /is/ distinct from a signal with no connection, so it is not likely a connection issue.

- The noise is unexpectedly lower at 39 kΩ than at 390 Ω.  10 MΩ is higher, so it may be worth measuring some resistors in between.
- Before measuring more, last session's suggestion to use two batteries is implemented.  Two batteries are connected in series.  The positive pole is connected to the positive power rail.  The negative has been connected to the top-right negative power rail.  The other three negative power rails are still ground.
- End of session.  Plan for next session:
  - Redo some measurements with the changed setup;
  - Investigate the possibility of using the myDAQ instead of the oscilloscope;
  - Measure gain using function generator or myDAQ.
